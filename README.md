I made this game in Unity, Blender, and GIMP to showcase my ability to script in C#. Very little of this work is not by my own hand.


However,

If you find any hidden messages or phone numbers in the code, I suppose they get credit where it's due.
I recommend playing first.

Credit to my sister, Sigrid Jakobsen as voice/sound talent.
